Simply put, the frontend is the interface that directly interacts with users, while the backend handles data and logic on the server side.</p> <strong>frontend</strong> <strong>backend</strong> <p>For the frontend, mastering JavaScript is essential as it is the mainstay of web frontend development and the standard scripting language of browsers.</p> <p>For the backend, there are various technology stacks. C++/Java/Python/Golang are common choices, and JavaScript can also be used for backend development with the node.js framework.</p> <p>For example, in web development, Java/node.js/Python are common choices for the backend. Golang is primarily used for cloud-native development, C++ for high-performance systems, and Python is the mainstream language in AI and data analysis fields.</p> <p>In actual work, people usually work with multiple languages simultaneously, and when you switch jobs, the technology stack of the new company is likely different from the old one, requiring you to learn anew. Therefore, programming languages are just tools, and your career will inevitably involve multiple languages.</p> <p>For your first language, if you aim to work in frontend-related fields, then learning JavaScript is essential, and you can choose JavaScript. If you plan to work in backend-related fields, look into your desired niche area to choose an appropriate programming language.</p> <p><strong>If you haven't decided yet, I would recommend starting with Python</strong>. Python is easy to learn, practical, and convenient for writing automation scripts and the like.</p> <strong>If you haven't decided yet, I would recommend starting with Python</strong> <p>Moreover, an important factor is that various AI platforms currently offer excellent support for Python, making it more convenient to have AI assist you in writing Python scripts.</p> <footer class=\"vp-page-meta\"><!----><div class=\"vp-meta-item git-info\"><div class=\"update-time\"><span class=\"vp-meta-label\">Last Updated:</span><time class=\"vp-meta-info\" datetime=\"2025-07-21T03:29:25.280Z\" data-allow-mismatch>7/21/25, 11:29 AM</time></div><!----></div></footer> <div class=\"vp-meta-item git-info\"><div class=\"update-time\"><span class=\"vp-meta-label\">Last Updated:</span><time class=\"vp-meta-info\" datetime=\"2025-07-21T03:29:25.280Z\" data-allow-mismatch>7/21/25, 11:29 AM</time></div><!----></div> <div class=\"update-time\"><span class=\"vp-meta-label\">Last Updated:</span><time class=\"vp-meta-info\" datetime=\"2025-07-21T03:29:25.280Z\" data-allow-mismatch>7/21/25, 11:29 AM</time></div> <span class=\"vp-meta-label\">Last Updated:</span> <time class=\"vp-meta-info\" datetime=\"2025-07-21T03:29:25.280Z\" data-allow-mismatch>7/21/25, 11:29 AM</time> <nav class=\"vp-page-nav\"><a class=\"route-link auto-link prev\" href=\"/algo/en/intro/how-to-practice/\" aria-label=\"How to Practice\"><div class=\"hint\"><span class=\"arrow start\"></span>Prev</div><div class=\"link\"><!---->How to Practice</div></a><a class=\"route-link auto-link next\" href=\"/algo/en/programming-language-basic/cpp/\" aria-label=\"C++ Basics\"><div class=\"hint\">Next<span class=\"arrow end\"></span></div><div class=\"link\">C++ Basics<!----></div></a></nav> <a class=\"route-link auto-link prev\" href=\"/algo/en/intro/how-to-practice/\" aria-label=\"How to Practice\"><div class=\"hint\"><span class=\"arrow start\"></span>Prev</div><div class=\"link\"><!---->How to Practice</div></a> <div class=\"hint\"><span class=\"arrow start\"></span>Prev</div> <span class=\"arrow start\"></span> <div class=\"link\"><!---->How to Practice</div> <a class=\"route-link auto-link next\" href=\"/algo/en/programming-language-basic/cpp/\" aria-label=\"C++ Basics\"><div class=\"hint\">Next<span class=\"arrow end\"></span></div><div class=\"link\">C++ Basics<!----></div></a> <div class=\"hint\">Next<span class=\"arrow end\"></span></div> <span class=\"arrow end\"></span> <div class=\"link\">C++ Basics<!----></div> <div style=\"justify-content:center;display:flex;\" data-v-95bd7423><div class=\"artalkCommentsContainer\" data-v-95bd7423><div id=\"artalkComments\" style=\"display:none;\" data-v-95bd7423></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:10px;\" data-v-95bd7423><!----></div></div></div> <div class=\"artalkCommentsContainer\" data-v-95bd7423><div id=\"artalkComments\" style=\"display:none;\" data-v-95bd7423></div><div style=\"margin-bottom:10px;\" data-v-95bd7423><!----></div></div> <div id=\"artalkComments\" style=\"display:none;\" data-v-95bd7423></div> <div style=\"margin-bottom:10px;\" data-v-95bd7423><!----></div>"
